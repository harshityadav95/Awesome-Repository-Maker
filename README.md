## Awesome How to Contribute 

### Contribute using GPT 

I used the GPT-4o model to generate the code for LetterDrop. That means the code is generated by the AI model, and I only need to provide the prompts to the model. This approach is very efficient and can save a lot of time. 
That also means you can easily customize the code by changing the prompts. You can find the prompts in the  PROMPT file.

Even I use the GPT model to generate the code, I still need to review the code and test it. So if you find any issues or have any suggestions, please feel free to create an issue or pull request. And there is no restriction on the contribution, you can contribute to any part of the project by yourself or with the help of the GPT model.
